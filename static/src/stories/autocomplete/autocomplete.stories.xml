        <h1> AutoComplete </h1>

        <p> The autocomplete component is a user interface element that allows users to quickly
        search and select from a pre-defined list of options. <br/>
        It works by dynamically filtering the list of options based on the user's input,
        presenting only those options that match the user's typed input.</p>

        Play with the props underneath and sees the results above!
